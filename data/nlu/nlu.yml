- intent: ask_strength_q9
  examples: |
    - Neural Adaptation Training vs. Hypertrophy Training?
       # By doing hypertrophy-type training, the neural output is fairly low (as compared to power training) and is not sufficient to simulate the motor neurons to "bud" (increase the number of muscle fibers in the motor unit they innervate).

- intent: ask_strength_q10
  examples: |
    - Resuming workouts after 2 months. Any beginner workout suggestions?

- intent: ask_strength_q11
  examples: |
    - Why aren't stiff legged deadlifts bad for your back?
       # Despite its name, proper form in this exercise requires a slight bend of the knees and when you bend down you need to be letting the middle of your body lean backwards over your center of gravity.

- intent: ask_strength_q12
  examples: |
    - How can I increase the number of push-ups I can do?

  examples: |
    - How can the conventional deadlift be harder at the top than the bottom?
      # Answering your question showed me that at (or around) that point, the quads become less dominant and the load is transferred to the hamstrings and glutes.

    - The value of strength training vs. the time/effort it takes
      # 1.To live long and with a high quality of life (includes cognitive benefits, ability to use my body effectively long term, avoiding medical problems, etc.)     The extra time for strength training is definitely worth it for all of your goals, but esp.

  examples: |
    - How can I increase the number of push-ups I can do?
      # The variations in resistance, targeting different muscle groups, and working towards a burn-out all contributed to breaking the muscle down to the point where it would grow back stronger during the recovery period.

- intent: ask_strength_q23
  examples: |
    - Losing weight without losing muscle
      # You could increase the number of sets to keep volume constant, or you could just do three very heavy sets of 3 and call it a day for your strength maintenance work.

  examples: |
    - Good form with little weight or bad form with a lot of weight?
      # It's possible that the people you watch have different goals than you, like hypertrophy rather than strength, or bragging rights about the weight they curl instead of actually improving their curl.

  examples: |
    - How can I improve my vertical?
      # The focus is on an isolated jump, per the combine, but perhaps with some practice to drive these techniques into muscle memory you could work them into real-world usage i.e. basketball.

    - How to overcome grip strength as sticking point for deadlifts?
      # There are three main ways to grip the bar for deadlifts that are competition legal: overhand (weakest), hook grip (rough on the thumbs), and mixed grip (one hand suppinated, strongest).

- intent: ask_strength_q28
  examples: |
    - What is the simplest way to measure strength?
    # "It tests strength with one-repetition maximum lifts in the squat, deadlift, and bench press.
      #The squat/bench/deadlift is well balanced for overall strength--though it omits a pulling motion--but a one-repetition maximum in many lifts can test strength."

    - Can I increase flexibility by strengthening muscles?
      # You could check out the following link as a starting point:  https://www.precisionmovement.coach/front-splits-mobility-technique/    I have gone from a very stiff left hip to a much more flexible and mobile state.

  examples: |
    - what's the reality that keeps progressive strength training from being constant?
    # "All you need at that point is a different way to manage your training volume and intensity.
      #The most assured way to build strength is to increase the volume of work."

    - How to exercise for kyphosis?
      # If you're having trouble hitting depth with the squat (you should be able to touch your butt to your ankles), this is a good stretch:     *Note: You should use your elbows to push your knees as far out as possible in this position as well.

    - Which muscles would I need to train for ambulance work?
      # Also look at all the different components to each task as you have described:  squatting, lifting, carrying, walking forwards and backwards, climbing up and down stairs forwards and backwards, pushing, pulling, gripping etc.

  examples: |
    - What credibility or scientific backing does 1g protein per 1lb of body weight have for its applications?
      # This study  examined nitrogen balance and lean body mass preservation related to protein intake, and found that when not training, bodybuilders needed little more than sedentary to maintain mass, while protein needs did increase during training, and endurance athletes needed more than bodybuilders, being 1.12 x sedentary control levels for bodybuilders, and 1.67 x sedentary control for endurance training.

    - How can I best recover for a second strength workout on the same day?
    # "I'd focus on nailing my first post-workout meal and making sure I have enough energy for the second workout.
      #I'd try to eat a meal or snack about two hours before the second workout."
- intent: ask_strength_q37
  examples: |
    - Are multiple sets with decreasing weight and no rest between them a good idea?
     # "This process of lifting a heavy weight several times, then immediately doing the same exercise with lower weight for many reps, is called strip or drop sets.
      #That's why bodybuilders prefer drop sets - because they're decidedly geared towards increasing muscle size (hypertrophy)."

  examples: |
    - Does “Greasing the groove” work and if so why?
      # However, what Thibaudeau is probably describing is neural fatigue, and this is why commentators (Bompa and others) recommend periodising strength training to allow the nervous system time to recover.

    - To count or not to count?
     # "If you could only do 10 pushups for years, then tried a new exercise and all the sudden you can do 50 pushups, you might want to example that and see why there was a change.
      #For weight lifting, you don't want to do too many reps."

    - Do isometric exercises decrease flexibility?
    # "I'll try to answer this another way, and state that full range of motion (ROM) exercises do indeed increase flexibility.
      #But provided you are stretching your body in other ways, I believe the range of motion will stay."

    - What is a low-impact exercise routine that slowly progresses towards more normal exercises?
     # "You can get a good cardio workout,  run in water , swim, stretch, do martial arts and strengthen with water exercises.
      #For example, if you strengthen your hip muscles they can lessen the stress on your knee joints."

    - What are the target muscles of kettlebell swings
      # Performing a proper two-hand kettlebell swing is a whole-body workout as opposed to isolating single muscles.

- intent: ask_strength_q44
  examples: |
    - Are partial reps okay?
      # The pros of partial reps include the fact that you can carry on with an exercise when you can no longer do full ROM with good form, and you still want to push it a bit further to exert a smaller subset of the muscle group more.

- intent: ask_strength_q45
  examples: |
    - why do we need more rest when lifting heavy?
    # "They need a break to be ready for the next lifting.
      #In that break time, they undergo repair and get nourished and grow stronger."

    - Are the basic barbell lifts not enough for the “core”?
      # In most of the academic literature, the core is understood to be comprised of three muscle groups: the  diaphragm  at the top, the  pelvic floor  complex at the bottom, and the deep  multifidus  and superficial  transversus abdominis  in the middle.

    - Can I add in some core exercises to SL 5x5 and what do you suggest if so?
    # "Secondly, the squat, deadlift, and overhead press are all core exercises, and quite good ones.
