  # This study  examined nitrogen balance and lean body mass preservation related to protein intake, and found that when not training, bodybuilders needed little more than sedentary to maintain mass, while protein needs did increase during training, and endurance athletes needed more than bodybuilders, being 1.12 x sedentary control levels for bodybuilders, and 1.67 x sedentary control for endurance training.
    - What credibility or scientific backing does 1g protein per 1lb of body weight have for its applications?

  # "I'd focus on nailing my first post-workout meal and making sure I have enough energy for the second workout.
      #I'd try to eat a meal or snack about two hours before the second workout."
    - How can I best recover for a second strength workout on the same day?

  # "This process of lifting a heavy weight several times, then immediately doing the same exercise with lower weight for many reps, is called strip or drop sets.
      #That's why bodybuilders prefer drop sets - because they're decidedly geared towards increasing muscle size (hypertrophy)."
    - Are multiple sets with decreasing weight and no rest between them a good idea?

  # However, what Thibaudeau is probably describing is neural fatigue, and this is why commentators (Bompa and others) recommend periodising strength training to allow the nervous system time to recover.

  # "If you could only do 10 pushups for years, then tried a new exercise and all the sudden you can do 50 pushups, you might want to example that and see why there was a change.

  # "I'll try to answer this another way, and state that full range of motion (ROM) exercises do indeed increase flexibility.
      #But provided you are stretching your body in other ways, I believe the range of motion will stay."
    - Do isometric exercises decrease flexibility?

  # The pros of partial reps include the fact that you can carry on with an exercise when you can no longer do full ROM with good form, and you still want to push it a bit further to exert a smaller subset of the muscle group more.
    - Are partial reps okay?

  # "They need a break to be ready for the next lifting.
      #In that break time, they undergo repair and get nourished and grow stronger."
    - why do we need more rest when lifting heavy?

  # In most of the academic literature, the core is understood to be comprised of three muscle groups: the  diaphragm  at the top, the  pelvic floor  complex at the bottom, and the deep  multifidus  and superficial  transversus abdominis  in the middle.
    - Are the basic barbell lifts not enough for the “core”?

  # "Secondly, the squat, deadlift, and overhead press are all core exercises, and quite good ones.
